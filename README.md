# Telecom_Churn_prediction  
One of the leading telecom company wants to increase customer retention.This is a big business problem because it is more expensive to aquire  a new customer than to keep an existing one from leaving. Implemented the Logistic Regression model  to predict whether a particular customer will switch to another telecom provider or not. The implementation was done using the Logistic Regression and Principal Component Analysis and got 82 % accuracy.
